- Index projects and keep index up-to-date
- Make changes but do not handle commits
- Make commit messages short and concise and use the Conventional Commit message
  convention
- Supabase: Row Level Security should always be enabled on all tables and policies should
  be created when necessary to ensure all features function correctly
- Do not try to automatically connect to any database and make changes. All database changes must be done manually by me. Create migration files.
- Don't use fallback data aproaches, instead, log and throw an error when
  something required is missing or has an error.
