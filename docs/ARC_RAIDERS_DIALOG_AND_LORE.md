# ARC Raiders — Dialog & Written Content Catalog

## Trader Voice Lines

> Sourced from [YouTube - Compilation][1]

- “Oh, hey there. I’m busy, but help yourself. Sorry. Didn’t see you coming.”
- “Thought you were Celeste for a second. What’s up? Oh, hey. Do you need anything? I’m busy.”
- “If you lose that, come back. Feel free to browse, but watch your step. Still in one piece, fella. What do you need today?”
- “Need a patch job? Nice to see you, fresh face. Don’t be shy, but honestly, you’re going to need my help.”
- “Come on in. Sit down. Take your pants off. Actually, don’t. Not wearing pants is kind of my thing. My favorite customer. Got yourself shot...”
- “Hey there, Raider. Looking to blow things up? I got you covered.”
- “That should heal you right up or perk you right up. Honestly, I didn’t pay attention to what you bought.”
- “If you want me to treat you, you better prove that those precious limbs of yours are worth bandaging. Show me you can grab some fabric next time you’re topside and I’ll think about whether you’re worthy of my talents.”

## Lore and World Book Narrative

> Sourced from [arcraiders.gg][2]

### The World: 2180

- ARC threatens any possible settlement on the surface.
- The mysterious machines of ARC patrol the Rust Belt of South Calabretta; when one machine falls, another quickly takes its place.
- In the hidden city of Speranza, thousands seek shelter underground. Many rely on vital supplies from the surface to survive.

### The Fall of Civilization

- Years ago, the arrival of ARC machines changed everything—their origin remains a mystery.
- Civilization collapsed, and the surface of Earth became a deadly playground for mechanical invaders.
- Small communities formed in the remnants of subway systems, bunkers, and caves, known as the Underground.

### The Exodus

- The wealthy and powerful initiated a mass evacuation to off-world colonies (Acerra Spaceport).
- Only a fraction could escape, leaving billions behind to survive in a world now ruled by ARC.

### The Raiders

- Raiders are rogue gunslingers and adventurers brave enough to scavenge resources, fight ARC, and bring back materials underground.
- Raiders repurpose trinkets and ARC parts into new items and weapons.

### The First Wave

- The initial ARC invasion nearly wiped out humanity.
- Key battles (e.g., Alcantara Power Plant "The Dam") helped survivors learn ARC weaknesses.

### The Rust Belt

- Raiders operate in diverse surface environments: arid deserts, waterlogged battlegrounds, and toxic industrial zones.

### Present Day

- Humanity survives underground; Raiders venture to the surface known as the "Rust Belt" for resources.
- Cities are buried, waterlogged, or reclaimed by nature; strange new ecologies evolve under ARC’s influence.

## Codex & Journals (Partial)

> Sourced from [Destructoid] and video guides[3][4]
